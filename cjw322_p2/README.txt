A grocery list app allowing users to make a list of groceries with quantities

CHALLENGE #1: Prevent the user from adding "empty" items to the grocery list
I wasn't able to fully complete this
But in this app, the user won't be able to enter empty values into the dictionary; if there's no input under "Item," nothing is added.

CHALLENGE #2: Add a lock button which would prevent users from adding or removing items.
There's a lock button; when the user taps it, it changes from locked to unlocked. When the app is locked, users cannot add or remove any items.

CHALLENGE #4: Add a button to remove items from the grocery list.
The remove button removes inputted items.
